# Random Dungeon Generator (Game Maker Studio 2.3)

**Introduction**<br/>
This Random Dungeon Generator combines user-defined chambers to create a dungeon.<br/>
The user-defined chambers are simple sprites that use color coding (user can customize the color detection).<br/>
<br/>
**Requirements**
* At least Game Maker Studio 2.3
* Some sprites

**Creating chamber sprites** <br/>
Without chamber sprites there can be no dungeon. 
Each chamber sprite needs some ground and connectors. At least one connector on two different sides need to be placed on a chamber.

**How Connectors work** <br/>


**Limitations** <br/>
* Can not limit how many times each chamber is used
* Builts one long dungeon from start to end but does NOT create branches
* Depending on the chamber layout crossing hallways could appear
