# Random Dungeon Generator (Game Maker Studio 2.3)

**Introduction** <br/>
This Random Dungeon Generator combines user-defined chambers to create a dungeon.<br/>
The user-defined chambers are simple sprites that use color coding (user can customize the color detection).<br/>
<br/>
**Requirements** <br/>
* At least Game Maker Studio 2.3
* Some sprites
<br/>
**Creating chamber sprites** <br/>
Without chamber sprites there can be no dungeon. 
Each chamber sprite needs some ground and connectors. At least one connector on two different sides need to be placed on a chamber.
<br/>
**How Connectors work** <br/>


The sample project comes with a list of sample sprites to use.

**Limitations** <br/>
